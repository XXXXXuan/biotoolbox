# BioToolBox Documentation

General documentation and usage notes for using the BioToolBox package.

- [Advanced Installation](AdvancedInstallation.md)

	Additional documentation on installing the Bio::ToolBox package under a Perl 
	installation, installing library modules for reading and writing binary formats 
	such as Bam, bigWig, and bigBed formats, as well as other non-required but 
	helpful Perl modules. Also notes on building some legacy adapters.

- [MacOS-specific Installation Notes](MacOSNotes.md)

	Even though MacOS is unix, it has its own idiosyncrasies that I've discovered 
	myself, and are written here in hope that they may be helpful to someone somewhere.

- [Script Examples](Scripts.md)

	Some common-scenario, real-world examples of using the included scripts to do 
	something useful.

- [Included Libraries](Libraries.md)

	The Bio::ToolBox package includes a number of Perl modules with extensive 
	documentation that can be used in custom scripts. This is a brief explanation of 
	what is available.

- [FAQ](FAQ.md)

	Frequently Asked Questions. OK, maybe not frequently, but this is basically a 
	list of questions, tips, and hints that only the programmer knows but would be 
	useful for others to know.
